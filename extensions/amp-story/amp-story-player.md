## AMP story player

The `amp-story-player` allows you to embed and play your favorite stories in your own website.

### Boilerplate

The following markup is a decent starting point or boilerplate. Copy this and save it to a file with a `.html` extension.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script
      async
      src="https://cdn.ampproject.org/amp-story-player-v0.js"
    ></script>
    <link
      href="https://cdn.ampproject.org/amp-story-player-v0.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      type="text/css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>This is a NON-AMP page that embeds a story below:</h1>
    <amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
      <a
        href="https://www-washingtonpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/lifestyle/travel/amp-stories/a-locals-guide-to-what-to-eat-and-do-in-new-york-city/"
        style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www-washingtonpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/i/s/www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/lifestyle/travel/amp-stories/a-locals-guide-to-what-to-eat-and-do-in-new-york-city/img/promo3x4.jpg');"
      >
        <span class="title"
          >A localâ€™s guide to what to eat and do in New York City</span
        >
      </a>
    </amp-story-player>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Features

- Improved experience over time (AKA the "Software as a Service" paradigm)
- Prerendering (coming soon!)
- Prefetching and caching resources (coming soon!)
- Customizable embed UI / chrome (coming soon!)
- Swipe/tap to next/previous (coming soon!)

### API

The high-level API for the player looks like the following:

```html
<amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
  <a href="https://www.example.com/story1.html"></a>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/story2.html"></a>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/story3.html"></a>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/story4.html"></a>
</amp-story-player>
```

To provide a better experience for the user while the story is being loaded, you can provide some text inside the anchor tags.

You can also provide an image to work as a placeholder while the story is being loaded. Just add a `--story-player-poster` CSS variable as an inline style of the first anchor tag with its corresponding url:

```html
<amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
  <a
    href="https://www.example.com/story.html"
    style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www.example.com/assets/cover1.html');"
  >
    <span>A title that describes this story.</span>
  </a>
</amp-story-player>
```
