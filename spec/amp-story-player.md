      position: relative;
      height: 100%;
      width: 100%;
      flex: 0 0 100%;
    }

    .title {

        rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)

      href="https://www-washingtonpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/lifestyle/travel/amp-stories/a-locals-guide-to-what-to-eat-and-do-in-mexico-city/"
      style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www-washingtonpost-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/lifestyle/travel/amp-stories/a-locals-guide-to-what-to-eat-and-do-in-mexico-city/img/promo3x4.jpg')"

      A localâ€™s guide to what to eat and do in Mexico City
    </a>
  </amp-story-player>
</body>
```

### Attributes

The inline width and height ensures that the player will not cause any jumps in your website while the script is being loaded. Feel free to modify the values, but we recommend maintaining a 3:5 aspect ratio.

#### width [recommended]

Width of the player in pixels.

#### height [recommended]

Height of the player in pixels.

## Specify embedded story

The `<amp-story-player>` component contains one `<a>` tag. Point the href attribute to the story URL.

Place descriptive text of the story within the `<a>` tag. This provides a better user experience and allows search engines to crawl embedded stories.

Use a poster image as a placeholder to display to users while the story loads. Add the `--story-player-poster` CSS variable as an inline style of the `<a>` tag and point to the poster image URL.

### Attributes

#### href

URL pointing to the story.

#### style="--story-player-poster: url('...');" [recommended]

CSS variable with the URL pointing to the poster image of the story.

```html
<amp-story-player style="width: 360px; height: 600px;">
  <a
    href="https://www.example.com/story.html"
    style="--story-player-poster: url('https://www.example.com/assets/cover1.html');"
  >
    A title that describes this story.
  </a>
</amp-story-player>
```
